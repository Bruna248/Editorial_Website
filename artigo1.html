                        <p>For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer
                            who is legendary for using a very limited number of typefaces. Between 1980 and 1990, most
                            of my
                            projects were set in five fonts: Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond no.3, Century
                            Expanded,
                            and, of course, Bodoni. </p>
                        <p>For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. "In the new computer
                            age,"
                            he once wrote, "the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level
                            of
                            visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a
                            few
                            basic ones, and trash the rest." For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours
                            choosing between Bembo, Sabon and Garamond no. 3 every time you needed a Venetian Roman? For
                            most people — my mom, for instance — these were distinctions without differences. Why not
                            just
                            commit to Garamond No. 3 and never think about it again? My Catholic school education must
                            have
                            well prepared me for this kind of moral clarity. I accepted it gratefully.</p>

                            Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any typeface I wanted, and I
                            went nuts. On one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife, who
                            had attended Catholic school herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates
                            who had switched to public school after eight years under the nuns: freed at last from
                            demure plaid uniforms, they wore the shortest skirts they could find. "Jesus," she said,
                            looking at one of my multiple font demolition derbies. "You've become a real slut, haven't
                            you?"</p>
                        <p>    
                            It was true. Liberated from monogamy, I became typographically promiscuous. I have since, I
                            think, learned to modulate my behavior — like any substance abuser, I learned that binges
                            are time-consuming, costly, and ultimately counterproductive — but I've never gone back to
                            five-typeface sobriety. Those thousands of typefaces are still out there, but my recovery
                            has required that I become more discriminating and come up with some answers to this
                            seemingly simple question: why choose a particular typeface? Here are thirteen reasons.
