                        <p>For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer
                            who is legendary for using a very limited number of typefaces. Between 1980 and 1990, most
                            of my
                            projects were set in five fonts: Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond no.3, Century
                            Expanded,
                            and, of course, Bodoni. </p>
                        <p>For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. "In the new computer
                            age,"
                            he once wrote, "the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level
                            of
                            visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a
                            few
                            basic ones, and trash the rest." For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours
                            choosing between Bembo, Sabon and Garamond no. 3 every time you needed a Venetian Roman? For
                            most people — my mom, for instance — these were distinctions without differences. Why not
                            just
                            commit to Garamond No. 3 and never think about it again? My Catholic school education must
                            have
                            well prepared me for this kind of moral clarity. I accepted it gratefully.</p>

                            Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any typeface I wanted, and I
                            went nuts. On one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife, who
                            had attended Catholic school herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates
                            who had switched to public school after eight years under the nuns: freed at last from
                            demure plaid uniforms, they wore the shortest skirts they could find. "Jesus," she said,
                            looking at one of my multiple font demolition derbies. "You've become a real slut, haven't
                            you?"</p>
                        <p>
                            It was true. Liberated from monogamy, I became typographically promiscuous. I have since, I
                            think, learned to modulate my behavior — like any substance abuser, I learned that binges
                            are time-consuming, costly, and ultimately counterproductive — but I've never gone back to
                            five-typeface sobriety. Those thousands of typefaces are still out there, but my recovery
                            has required that I become more discriminating and come up with some answers to this
                            seemingly simple question: why choose a particular typeface? Here are thirteen reasons.
                        </p>

                                    an aura of manifest destiny that is positively irresistible. I haven't had that luck
                                    yet, but still try to find the same kind of evocative alignment.

                                    both share an expressiveness peculiar to the postwar optimism of the 1950's.

                                    Once I saw a project in a student portfolio that undertook the dubious challenge of
                                    redesigning the Tiffany's identity. I particularly disliked the font that was used,
                                    and I politely asked what it was.

                                    Recently, I designed a publications program for a girls' school. I used a typeface
                                    that was designed by a woman and named after another, Zuzana Licko's Mrs. Eaves. In
                                    both cases, my clients knew that the public would be completely unaware of the story
                                    behind the font selection, but took some comfort in it nonetheless. I did too.

                                    strong-minded architects. I picked Cheltenham, an idiosyncratic typeface that was
                                    not only well-suited to the project's requirements, but was one of the few I know
                                    that was designed by an architect, Bertram Goodhue.

                                    About 10 years ago, I was asked to redesign the logo for New York magazine. Milton
                                    Glaser had based the logo on Bookman Swash Italic, a typeface I found unimaginably
                                    dated and ugly. But Glaser's logo had replaced an earlier one by Peter Palazzo that
                                    was based on Caslon Italic.

                                    I proposed we return to Caslon, and distinctly remember saying, "Bookman Swash
                                    Italic is always going to look ugly." The other day, I saw something in the office
                                    that really caught my eye. It was set in Bookman Swash Italic, and it looked great.
                                    Ugly, but great.

                                    Tibor Kalman was fascinated with boring typefaces. "No, this one is too clever, this
                                    one is too interesting," he kept saying when showed him the fonts I was proposing
                                    for his monograph. Anything but a boring typeface, he felt, got in the way of the
                                    ideas. We settled on Trade Gothic.

                                    few. A true fundamentalist requires a monotheistic worldview: one world, one
                                    typeface. The designers at Experimental Jetset have made the case for Helvetica.

                                    written, many of which first appeared here on Design Observer. I wanted it to feel
                                    like a real book for readers — it has no pictures — so I asked Abbott to design it.
                                    He suggested we set each one of the 79 pieces in a different typeface.

                                    one called 'I Hate ITC Garamond?'" I asked him. "Would we set it in ITC Garamond?"
                                    He looked at me as if I was crazy. "Of course," he said. The book is beautiful, by
                                    the way, and not the least bit slutty.
